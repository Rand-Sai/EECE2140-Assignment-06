#Assignment06 - Problem Geometric Shapes Calculation

#Design a base class called Shape with methods area() and perimeter() which will be overridden by
#derived classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Each subclass should have attributes specific to the
#details required to calculate the area and perimeter. Create a list of shapes and iterate over it, printing out
#the area and perimeter of each shape, demonstrating polymorphism
